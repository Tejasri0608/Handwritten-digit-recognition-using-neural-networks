**Tools:** TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, PyQt5


**Objective:** Developed a neural network model for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

Built and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) with multiple convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers, achieving high accuracy in digit recognition. Implemented a PyQt5-based GUI application allowing users to either draw digits on a canvas or upload images for recognition.
Integrated image preprocessing steps including resizing, normalization, and reshaping to ensure compatibility with the trained model. Created a seamless user experience with options for drawing, clearing the canvas, and real-time digit prediction.

To run the project
1. clone the repository
2. run the main.ipnyb 1st kernel to develop the model
3. the model is now saved as mnsit_model.h5
4. run the gui to test
